<h1 id="next-clone">Next web clone - Responsive Design</h1>

<p>Fifth project of the <a href="https://www.microverse.org/">Microverse</a> curriculum from the CSS3 and HTML section.</p>

<p>In this project, you’ll get the chance to build a responsive website. We’ll be cloning The Next Web, a tech-focused magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced.</p>

You can look at the original site [here](https://thenextweb.com/).
